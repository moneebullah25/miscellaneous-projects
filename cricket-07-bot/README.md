# Cricket-07-Bot
I have created four different versions of bots for Cricket 2007 game. They work all the same. Bot play as a batsman when the timing guage is ON. In my second, third and fourth attempt bot also differentiate which shot to play with button 's' and which shot to play with button 'w'. And the rest of the controlls need to be control by player by judging which side is suitable to play the shot. Shift key need to be control by player also. Only the S and W key will be controll by bot. Bot click this two key when there is a perfect time shown on the timing guage. 

First Ateempt file only controll s key
